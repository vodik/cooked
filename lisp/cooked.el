;;; cooked.el --- A terminal that hands the keyboard back -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Keywords: terminals, processes

;;; Commentary:

;; A terminal emulator whose input model follows what the child actually wants.
;; The kernel's line discipline says when a program is doing a canonical read;
;; OSC 133 says when the shell is at a prompt.  In either case Emacs owns the
;; line and you edit it as you would any buffer.  Otherwise keys are forwarded
;; verbatim and the emulator behaves as a terminal.

;;     :load-path "/path/to/cooked/lisp"
;;     :commands (cooked cooked-other-window
;;                cooked-project cooked-project-other-window
;;                cooked-here cooked-here-other-window)

;;     (require 'cooked-osc-eval)         ; opt in to the OSC 51 command channel
;;     (require 'cooked-shell-completion) ; opt in to the shell's own completion
;;     (require 'cooked-project))         ; opt in to project-scoped sessions
;;
;; Emulation happens in a Rust module, built on first use with cargo.
;;
;; This file is the core: rendering, colours, and the OSC handlers that are inert
;; enough to be on by default.  `cooked-mode' has the interaction.  The layers above
;; it are separate because you should choose them, and choosing one is `require'ing
;; its file rather than setting a variable: `cooked-evil', `cooked-osc-eval',
;; `cooked-shell-completion', `cooked-project', `cooked-file-link',
;; `cooked-next-error', `cooked-command-decorations', `cooked-dnd' and
;; `cooked-user-var'.  The snippet above names only the four most people want; the
;; other five load the same way.

;; The buffer is the scrollback.  Rows that scroll off the emulator's screen are
;; handed over once and become ordinary buffer text; the lines after
;; `cooked--screen-start' are the live screen, rewritten from damage reports.
;;
;; Invariant: buffer text equals the grid, plus any pending input rendered at the
;; cursor.  Every redisplay lifts the pending input out, applies the grid, and puts
;; it back.
;;
;; The two ends therefore hold one structure between them, and the boundary is the
;; only place they can disagree.  So the geometry of it is reported rather than
;; re-derived: `cooked--grid' carries the emulator's own account of how tall the
;; grid is, how much of it is occupied, and how much of the line straddling the
;; boundary has already been handed over.  Emacs owns the buffer and makes every
;; edit; it just does not get a second opinion about the shape it is editing to.
;; `cooked--check-seam' is that boundary stated as an assertion.

(cooked--declare-core)

;; Everything this file calls in the layers above it, which is to say everything
;; it calls upward.  Each one is a notification that something changed and the
;; layer that owns keymaps, buffer names or the buffer's own life should react —
;; never a question asked of that layer, which is why the list is short and stays
;; short.  Anything cooked.el needs an *answer* to belongs at this level instead;
;; see "Who owns the keyboard" below, which is where that rule moved the policy.
;;
;; `cooked--on-wake' is owned by cooked-render.el and is the same shape read from
;; the other end: `cooked--start' installs the wake pipe's filter because the
;; pipe is part of spawning a child, and the filter's whole body is "the core has
;; something; draw it" -- a notification handed to the pipeline, not a question
;; put to it.  It is the only thing this file needs of that one.

;;;; Entry points

;; Here rather than in cooked-mode.el, where the rest of the interaction lives,
;; because this is the file an installation names: `package.el' autoloads from it
;; and a `:load-path' install autoloads `cooked' from "cooked".  An autoload that
;; forwards to a second file does not chain -- Emacs signals rather than following
;; it -- so the commands themselves have to be reachable from here, and they pull
;; the interaction layer in when first called.

(defcustom cooked-display-action '((display-buffer-same-window
                                    display-buffer-pop-up-window))
  "Action `\\[cooked]' passes to `pop-to-buffer\='.

The selected window first, the way `vterm\=' and `eat\=' do it: a terminal is
usually what you want to be looking at, whereas the fallback `display-buffer\='
uses -- reuse a window, else split -- would put it beside the buffer you
invoked it from as often as not.  Splitting is still the second choice, for
when the selected window will not take it (a dedicated or side window), and
`\\[cooked-other-window]\=' remains the way to ask for the split on purpose.

The extra pair of parentheses is load-bearing, and their absence was the bug
this docstring described its way around for a long time.  A `display-buffer\='
action is (FUNCTIONS . ALIST), so the flat list read as FUNCTIONS =
`display-buffer-same-window\=' and ALIST = (display-buffer-pop-up-window) -- an
alist entry `assq\=' never asks for and so silently drops.  The second choice
therefore did not exist: a window that would not take the buffer fell through to
`display-buffer-fallback-action\=', whose first entry is
`display-buffer-reuse-window\=' -- the behaviour named two paragraphs up as the
one to avoid.

Here rather than in cooked-mode.el with the other session options, because
every command that reads it is here or in cooked-project.el, and each reads it
as an *argument* -- evaluated before the callee\='s `require\=' of cooked-mode
could have run.  Defined beside its readers, an autoloaded `\\[cooked]\=' in an
Emacs that has never loaded the interaction layer finds a value rather than a
void variable."
  ;; `sexp' rather than a hand-written (FUNCTIONS . ALIST) type: Emacs has no
  ;; public widget for a display action, and the one thing a narrower type here
  ;; could have caught -- the missing parentheses above -- it would only have
  ;; caught for a value set through Customize, which this one never was.

(defconst cooked-other-window-action '(display-buffer-pop-up-window)
  "Display action every `-other-window\=' command in cooked passes.

A constant rather than the literal written out at each of them: there are three
pairs of commands whose two halves differ in nothing else -- here, and the two
in cooked-project.el -- so the literal was the only thing saying they agree,
three times over.  Deliberately not a `defcustom\=': the customisable choice is
`cooked-display-action\=', and a command whose whole name is `other-window\='
has already been told what to do.")
